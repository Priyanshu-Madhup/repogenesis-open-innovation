It builds an encrypted channel over TCP, authenticates, then lets you open many logical \u201cpipes\u201d (channels) for remote login, file transfer, tunnels, etc. Components of Secure Shell (SSH) SSH-TRANS (Transport) SSH-AUTH (Authentication) SSH-CONN (Connection) Purpose: create a secure, encrypted channel. Guarantees: confidentiality (encryption), integrity (no tampering), server authentication, and optional compression. Analogy: locks the mailbox and seals letters before sending.Purpose: prove who you are (username + method: password, public-key, etc.). Outcome: server replies \u201csuccess\u201d or \u201cfail\u201d. Analogy: showing your ID to a guard before you enter a building.SSH-CONN (Connection) \u2014 top layer Purpose: multiplex many logical channels over the single secure transport (remote shell, sftp/scp, etc.).

Thus  \nresearch  is an art of  scient ific investigation  \n \nOBJECTIVES  OF ENGINEERING  RESEARCH  \n \nThe purpose of research is to discover answers to questions through the application of scientific  \nprocedures. The main aim of research is to find out the truth which is hidden and which has not  \nbeen d iscovered as yet. Though each research study has its own specific purpose, we may think  \nof research objectives as  falling  into a number of  following  broad  groupings:  \n \n1. Exploratory or Formulative research studies: To gain familiarity with a phenomenon or to  \nachieve  new insights into  it \n2. Descriptive research  studies:  To portray accurately the characteristics  of a particular  \nindividual,  situation or a  group  \nhttps://vtucode.in\nRM& IPR \u2013 BRMK557\n Page  2  \n 3. Diagnostic research studies: To determine the frequency with which something occurs or  \nwith which it is a ssociated with something  else \n4. Hypothesis -testing research studies: To test a hypothesis of a causal relationship between  \nvariables  \n \nThe objective  of engineering  research  is \n \n\uf0b7 To solve new and important problems, and since the conclusion at the end of one\u2018s  \nresearch  outcome  has to  be new, but  when one  starts, the conclusion is  unknown.  \n\uf0b7 Research objectives can sometimes be convoluted and difficult to follow.

For example:  my friends  are all doing  research  \nand so should  I, or, a person that  I dislike is doing  well and  I want  to do better.  \n\uf0b7 Personal motivation in solving unsolved problems, intellectual jo y, service to community,  \nand respectability  are all driving  factors.  \n \nThe following  factors would  be a mix of extrinsic and  intrinsic  aspects:  \n \n\uf0b7 Wanting  to do better  than what  has been achieved  in the  world  \n\uf0b7 Improve  the state  of the  art in technology  \n\uf0b7 Contrib ute to the  improvement of society  \n\uf0b7 Fulfillment  of the historical legacy  in the immediate  socio -cultural context.  \n \nSeveral  other  factors  like government  directives,  funding  opportunities  in certain  areas,  and \nterms  of employment,  can motivate  people  to get i nvolved  in engineering  research.  \n \nTYPES  OF ENGINEERING  RESEARCH  \n \nDescriptive  versus  Analytical:  \n \n\uf0b7 Descriptive research includes comparative and co relational methods, and fact -finding  \ninquiries, to effectively describe the present state of art",

But such activities overlap co ntinuously rather than following a strictly  \nprescribed  sequence  \n \n1. Formulating the research problem : There are two types of research problems, viz.,  \nthose  which  relate  to states  of nature  and those  which  relate  to relationships  between  \nhttps://v tucode.in\nRM& IPR \u2013 BRMK557\n Page  6  \n variables. At the ver y outset the researcher must single out the problem he wants to study,  \ni.e., he must decide the general area of interest or aspect of a subject -matter that he would  \nlike to inquire  into. \n2. Extensive literature survey : Once the problem is formulated, a brief summary of it  \nshould  be written  down.  It is compulsory  for a research  worker  writing  a thesis  for a \nPh.D. degree to write a synopsis of the topic and submit it to the necessary Committee or  \nthe Research  Board  for approval.  At this juncture  the researcher  should  undertake  \nextensive  literature  survey  connected  with the  problem.  \n3. Development  of working  hypotheses : After  extensive  literature  survey,  researcher  \nshould state in clear terms the working hypothesis or hypotheses. Working hypothesis is  \ntentative  assum ption  made  in order  to draw  out and test its logical  or empirical  \nconsequences.  \nHypothesis should be very specific and limited to the piece of research in hand because it  \nhas to be tested.

Preparing the research design : The research problem having been formulated in clear  \ncut terms, the researc her will be required to prepare a research design, i.e., he will have to  \nstate the conceptual structure within which research would be conducted. The preparation  \nof such a design  facilitates research to  be as  efficient  as possible  yielding maximal  \ninformat ion. In other  words,  the function  of research  design  is to provide  for the \ncollection  of relevant evidence  with minimal  expenditure  of effort,  time and money.  \n5. Determining sample design: The researcher must decide the way of selecting a sample  \nor what is po pularly known as the sample design. In other words, a sample design is a  \ndefinite plan determined before any data are actually collected for obtaining a sample  \nfrom a given population. Sampling can be done choosing a particular unit, random unit  \nselection,  systematic pattern, homogenous group (stratified sampling), quota, cluster or  \narea,  multi stages and  sequential.  \n6. Collecting the data : In dealing with any real life problem it is often found that data at  \nhand are inadequate, and hence, it becomes necessary  to collect data that are appropriate.  \nThere  are several  ways  of collecting  the appropriate  data which  differ  considerably  in \nhttps://v tucode.in\nRM& IPR \u2013 BRMK557\n Page  7  \n context  of money  costs,  time and other  resources  at the disposal  of the researcher.  \nPrimary  data can be collected  either  through  experiment  or through  survey.  If the \nresearcher conducts an experiment, he observes some quantitative measurements, or the  \ndata, with the help of which he examines the truth contained in his hypothesis. But in the  \ncase of a survey, data can be collected by  any one or more of the following ways by  \nobservation, through personal interview, through telephonic interview, by mailing the  \nquestionnaire  etc \n7. Execution of the project : It is a very important step in the research process. If the  \nexecution of the project  proceeds on correct lines, the data to be collected would be  \nadequate and dependable. The researcher should see that the project is executed in a  \nsystematic  manner  and in time.  A careful  watch  should  be kept for unanticipated  factors  \nin order to keep the  survey  as much realistic  as possible.  \n8",

The unwieldy data should  \nnecessarily be condensed into a few manageable groups and tables for further analysis.  \nThus,  researcher should  classify  the raw data into  some purposeful and  usable categories.  \n9. Hypothesis -testing : After analyzing the  data as stated  above,  the researcher is  in a \nposition to test the hypotheses, if any, he had formulated earlier. Do the facts support the  \nhypotheses or they hap pen to be contrary? This is the usual question which should be  \nanswered while testing hypotheses. Various tests, such as Chi square test, t -test, F -test, \nhave been developed by statisticians for the purpose. The hypotheses may be tested  \nthrough the use of one or more of such tests, depending upon the nature and object of  \nresearch inquiry. Hypothesis -testing will result in either accepting the hypothesis or in  \nrejecting  it. \n10. Generalizations and interpretation : If a hypothesis is tested and upheld several time s, it \nmay be possible for the researcher to arrive at generalization, i.e., to build a theory.

Such co -authorships can  be termed as ghost  \nco-authorship. Full disclosure of all those involved in the research is important so that  \nevaluation can happen both on the basis of findings, and also whether there was influence  \nfrom  the conflicts.  \n\uf0b7 In another type of questionable auth orship, some researchers list one another as coauthors  \nas a reciprocal gesture with no real collaboration except minimal reading and editing,  \nwithout  truly  reviewing  the work threadbare.  \n\uf0b7 Some authors, in trying to acquire a sole -authored work, despite rely ing on significant  \ncontribution  to the research  work  from  others,  recognize  that effort  only by an \nacknowledgment,  thereby  misrepresenting  the contributions of the  listed  authors.  \n\uf0b7 The unrecognized  \u2015author\u2016  is as a consequence,  unavailable  to readers  for el aboration",

The criterion encompasses:  \n\uf0b7 Novelty  - Not part of \u2018State  of the Art\u2019. The innovation  claimed  in the patent  application  \nis new and not known  to anybody  in the world.  In other  words,  the innovation is  \no not in the knowledge  of the  public,  \no not published  anywhere  through  any means of  publication  and \no not be claimed in  any other specification by  any other applicant.  \n\uf0b7 Inventive  step - Not obvious to the person  (s) skilled in the  art. The innov ation is  \no a technical  advancement  over the  existing  knowledge,  \no possesses  economic  significance  and, \no not obvious to  a person  skilled in  the concerned  subject.  \n\uf0b7 Capable  of industrial  application  - For the benefit  of society . The invention  is capable  of \nbeing  made or used in  any industry.  \n \nTO PATENT  OR NOT  TO PATENT  AN INVENTION  \n \n\uf0b7 Once an invention has been developed, the inventor has to decide whether to exploit the  \ninvention for personal benefits as provided by the statutory laws of the country or put it in  \nthe public  domain.  \n\uf0b7 By and large, the inventor prefers the former option. Only a miniscule of inventions is  \nplaced  in the  public  domain without claiming  any benefits.  \n  Page 15 https://v tucode.in\nRM& IPR \u2013 BRMK557\n  \n \uf0b7 In the latter case, anybody can exploit the innovation for commercial or societal benefit  \nwithout paying  any money  to the  inventor.  \n\uf0b7 If the owner of an invention wishes to seek monetary gains, he can choose from either of  \nthe two options, i.e. patenting or Trade Secret.  If the inventor is  absolutely sure of  \nmaintaining the secrecy of invention for  a very long period (maybe 100 years or more)  \nand the probability of reverse engineering of the technology is nil or very low, then the  \n\u2015Trade  Secret\u2016 category  is preferred",

But,  \nit is not true.  \n\uf0b7 In fact, the majority of patents are granted to inventions displaying an improvement over  \nthe existing  invention.  \n\uf0b7 For example, many patents can be awarded to a  single molecule e.g. penicillin\u2018s (an  \nantibiotic that kills microbes) and its derivatives. The derivatives are made by making  \nsubtle changes  in the structure of the penicillin resulting in new/improved properties,  \nsuch as acid stability or temperature sta bility or killing a wide range of microbes (germs).  \nThe new antibiotic molecules, known  as second,  third or  fourth  generation penicillin\u2018s  \ncan also be patented",

Even hurriedly scribbled notes for an impromptu speec h are considered  \ncopyrightable  material.  \n\uf0b7 The Copyright work has to be expressed by the creator in his frame of thought. In other  \nwords, the work has to be original i.e. the author created it from independent thinking  \nvoid of duplication. This type of work is termed as an Original Work of Authorship  \n(OWA).  It may  appear similar  to already  existing  works but should not be the  same.  \n\uf0b7 The original work may lack quality or quantity or aesthetic merit or all these parameters;  \nstill, it will pass the  test of copyri ghtable  work.  \n    Page 2 https://v tucode.in\nRM& IPR\u2013 BRMK557\n  \n \uf0b7 In addition to originality for the work, Copyright protection also requires at least some  \ncreative effort on the part  of the  author.  \n\uf0b7 There is no minimum limit for the extent of creativeness. It is a subjective matter. The  \nminimal level of cr eativity needed for Copyright protection depends on the judgment of  \nthe evaluator  (adjudicated by  the Office  of Registrar  of Copyright).  \n\uf0b7 As an example, mere changing the dimensions of a book will not be granted Copyright  \nprotection. Similarly, an address b ook of alphabetically arranged telephone numbers does  \nnot qualify for Copyright protection as it involves a straightforward alphabetical listing of  \nphone  numbers rather  than a  creative  selection of  listings.  \n \nOWNERSHIP  OF COPYRIGHT  \n \nThe Copyright  laws clearly state the ownership  of Copyright.  \n \n\uf0b7 The person  who created  the work  is considered  as the first (original)  holder  (owner)  of \nthe Copyright.  \n\uf0b7 In case the author is an employee and has been contracted to do the work by a proprietor  \n(of the company/firm/soci ety /organization, etc.), the owner of the Copyright shall be the  \nproprietor.  \n\uf0b7 The government will be the primary owner of the government work in the absence of any  \nkind of arrangement.  \n\uf0b7 The person delivering  a speech  is the  first owner  of the  Copyright",

Ethics in  \nEngineering Research, Ethics in Engineering Research Practice, Types of Research Misconduct,  \nEthical  Issues Related to  Authorship.  \n \n  \n \nMEANING  OF RESEARCH  \n \n\uf0b7 Research  refers  to a careful,  well-defined  (or redefined),  objective,  and systematic  \nmethod of search  for knowledge,  or formulation  of a theory  that is driven  by \ninquisitiveness for that which is unknown and useful on a particular aspect so as to make  \nan original contribution to expand the existing  knowledge  base.  \n\uf0b7 Research involves formulati on of hypothesis or proposition of solutions, data analysis,  \nand deductions; and ascertaining  whether  the conclusions  fit the  hypothesis.  \n\uf0b7 Research is a process of creating, or formulating knowledge that does not yet exist. Thus  \nresearch  is an art of  scient ific investigation  \n \nOBJECTIVES  OF ENGINEERING  RESEARCH  \n \nThe purpose of research is to discover answers to questions through the application of scientific  \nprocedures. The main aim of research is to find out the truth which is hidden and which has not  \nbeen d iscovered as yet. Though each research study has its own specific purpose, we may think  \nof research objectives as  falling  into a number of  following  broad  groupings:  \n \n1. Exploratory or Formulative research studies: To gain familiarity with a phenomenon or to  \nachieve  new insights into  it \n2. Descriptive research  studies:  To portray accurately the characteristics  of a particular  \nindividual,  situation or a  group  \nhttps://vtucode.in\nRM& IPR \u2013 BRMK557\n Page  2  \n 3. Diagnostic research studies: To determine the frequency with which something occurs or  \nwith which it is a ssociated with something  else \n4. Hypothesis -testing research studies: To test a hypothesis of a causal relationship between  \nvariables  \n \nThe objective  of engineering  research  is \n \n\uf0b7 To solve new and important problems, and since the conclusion at the end of one\u2018s  \nresearch  outcome  has to  be new, but  when one  starts, the conclusion is  unknown.  \n\uf0b7 Research objectives can sometimes be convoluted and difficult to follow. Knowing where  \nand how to find different types of information helps one solve engineering problems, in  \nboth academic  and professional career.  \n\uf0b7 Lack of investigation into engineering guidelines, standards, and best practices result in  \nfailures with severe repercussions",

      "chunk": "As an engineer, the ability to conduct thorough and  \naccurate  research  while  clearly  communi cating  the results  is extremely  important  in \ndecision  making.  \n\uf0b7 The main aim of the research is to apply scientific approaches to seek answers to open  \nquestions,  and although  each research study  is particularly  suited for  a certain  approach  \n\uf0b7 The objectives of  engineering research should be to develop new theoretical or applied  \nknowledge  and not necessarily  limited to obtaining  abilities  to obtain the  desired  result.  \n\uf0b7 The objectives should be framed such that in the event of not being able to achieve the  \ndesired  result that is being sought, one can fall back to understanding why it is not  \npossible, because that is also a contribution toward ongoing research in solving that  \nproblem.  \n \nMOTIVATION  IN ENGINEERING  RESEARCH  \n \nThe possible motives may  be the result of one  or more  of the  following  desires:  \n \n\uf0b7 Studies have shown that intrinsic motivations like interest, challenge, learning, meaning,  \npurpose,  are linked to strong  creative  performance;  \n\uf0b7 Extrinsic motivating factors like rewards for good work include money, fame, awards,  \npraise,  and status  are very strong  motivators,  but may block  creativity.  For example:  \nhttps://v tucode.in\nRM& IPR \u2013 BRMK557\n Page  3  \n Research outcome may enable obtaining a patent which is a good way to become rich and  \nfamous.  \n\uf0b7 Influences from others like competition, collaboration, commitment,  and encouragement  \nare also motivating  factors  in research.  For example:  my friends  are all doing  research  \nand so should  I, or, a person that  I dislike is doing  well and  I want  to do better.  \n\uf0b7 Personal motivation in solving unsolved problems, intellectual jo y, service to community,  \nand respectability  are all driving  factors.  \n \nThe following  factors would  be a mix of extrinsic and  intrinsic  aspects:  \n \n\uf0b7 Wanting  to do better  than what  has been achieved  in the  world  \n\uf0b7 Improve  the state  of the  art in technology  \n\uf0b7 Contrib ute to the  improvement of society  \n\uf0b7 Fulfillment  of the historical legacy  in the immediate  socio -cultural context.  \n \nSeveral  other  factors  like government  directives,  funding  opportunities  in certain  areas,  and \nterms  of employment,  can motivate  people  to get i nvolved  in engineering  research.  \n \nTYPES  OF ENGINEERING  RESEARCH  \n \nDescriptive  versus  Analytical:  \n \n\uf0b7 Descriptive research includes comparative and co relational methods, and fact -finding  \ninquiries, to effectively describe the present state of art.

But such activities overlap co ntinuously rather than following a strictly  \nprescribed  sequence  \n \n1. Formulating the research problem : There are two types of research problems, viz.,  \nthose  which  relate  to states  of nature  and those  which  relate  to relationships  between  \nhttps://v tucode.in\nRM& IPR \u2013 BRMK557\n Page  6  \n variables. At the ver y outset the researcher must single out the problem he wants to study,  \ni.e., he must decide the general area of interest or aspect of a subject -matter that he would  \nlike to inquire  into. \n2. Extensive literature survey : Once the problem is formulated, a brief summary of it  \nshould  be written  down.  It is compulsory  for a research  worker  writing  a thesis  for a \nPh.D. degree to write a synopsis of the topic and submit it to the necessary Committee or  \nthe Research  Board  for approval.  At this juncture  the researcher  should  undertake  \nextensive  literature  survey  connected  with the  problem.  \n3. Development  of working  hypotheses : After  extensive  literature  survey,  researcher  \nshould state in clear terms the working hypothesis or hypotheses. Working hypothesis is  \ntentative  assum ption  made  in order  to draw  out and test its logical  or empirical  \nconsequences.  \nHypothesis should be very specific and limited to the piece of research in hand because it  \nhas to be tested. The role of the hypothesis is to guide the researcher by delimiting  the \narea of research and to keep him on the right track. It sharpens his thinking and focuses  \nattention  on the more  important facets of the problem",

Preparing the research design : The research problem having been formulated in clear  \ncut terms, the researc her will be required to prepare a research design, i.e., he will have to  \nstate the conceptual structure within which research would be conducted. The preparation  \nof such a design  facilitates research to  be as  efficient  as possible  yielding maximal  \ninformat ion. In other  words,  the function  of research  design  is to provide  for the \ncollection  of relevant evidence  with minimal  expenditure  of effort,  time and money.  \n5. Determining sample design: The researcher must decide the way of selecting a sample  \nor what is po pularly known as the sample design. In other words, a sample design is a  \ndefinite plan determined before any data are actually collected for obtaining a sample  \nfrom a given population. Sampling can be done choosing a particular unit, random unit  \nselection,  systematic pattern, homogenous group (stratified sampling), quota, cluster or  \narea,  multi stages and  sequential.  \n6. Collecting the data : In dealing with any real life problem it is often found that data at  \nhand are inadequate, and hence, it becomes necessary  to collect data that are appropriate.  \nThere  are several  ways  of collecting  the appropriate  data which  differ  considerably  in \nhttps://v tucode.in\nRM& IPR \u2013 BRMK557\n Page  7  \n context  of money  costs,  time and other  resources  at the disposal  of the researcher.  \nPrimary  data can be collected  either  through  experiment  or through  survey.  If the \nresearcher conducts an experiment, he observes some quantitative measurements, or the  \ndata, with the help of which he examines the truth contained in his hypothesis. But in the  \ncase of a survey, data can be collected by  any one or more of the following ways by  \nobservation, through personal interview, through telephonic interview, by mailing the  \nquestionnaire  etc \n7. Execution of the project : It is a very important step in the research process. If the  \nexecution of the project  proceeds on correct lines, the data to be collected would be  \nadequate and dependable. The researcher should see that the project is executed in a  \nsystematic  manner  and in time.  A careful  watch  should  be kept for unanticipated  factors  \nin order to keep the  survey  as much realistic  as possible.  \n8.

Hypothesis -testing : After analyzing the  data as stated  above,  the researcher is  in a \nposition to test the hypotheses, if any, he had formulated earlier. Do the facts support the  \nhypotheses or they hap pen to be contrary? This is the usual question which should be  \nanswered while testing hypotheses. Various tests, such as Chi square test, t -test, F -test, \nhave been developed by statisticians for the purpose. The hypotheses may be tested  \nthrough the use of one or more of such tests, depending upon the nature and object of  \nresearch inquiry. Hypothesis -testing will result in either accepting the hypothesis or in  \nrejecting  it. \n10. Generalizations and interpretation : If a hypothesis is tested and upheld several time s, it \nmay be possible for the researcher to arrive at generalization, i.e., to build a theory.

Such co -authorships can  be termed as ghost  \nco-authorship. Full disclosure of all those involved in the research is important so that  \nevaluation can happen both on the basis of findings, and also whether there was influence  \nfrom  the conflicts.  \n\uf0b7 In another type of questionable auth orship, some researchers list one another as coauthors  \nas a reciprocal gesture with no real collaboration except minimal reading and editing,  \nwithout  truly  reviewing  the work threadbare.  \n\uf0b7 Some authors, in trying to acquire a sole -authored work, despite rely ing on significant  \ncontribution  to the research  work  from  others,  recognize  that effort  only by an \nacknowledgment,  thereby  misrepresenting  the contributions of the  listed  authors.  \n\uf0b7 The unrecognized  \u2015author\u2016  is as a consequence,  unavailable  to readers  for el aboration",

The criterion encompasses:  \n\uf0b7 Novelty  - Not part of \u2018State  of the Art\u2019. The innovation  claimed  in the patent  application  \nis new and not known  to anybody  in the world.  In other  words,  the innovation is  \no not in the knowledge  of the  public,  \no not published  anywhere  through  any means of  publication  and \no not be claimed in  any other specification by  any other applicant.  \n\uf0b7 Inventive  step - Not obvious to the person  (s) skilled in the  art. The innov ation is  \no a technical  advancement  over the  existing  knowledge,  \no possesses  economic  significance  and, \no not obvious to  a person  skilled in  the concerned  subject.  \n\uf0b7 Capable  of industrial  application  - For the benefit  of society . The invention  is capable  of \nbeing  made or used in  any industry.  \n \nTO PATENT  OR NOT  TO PATENT  AN INVENTION  \n \n\uf0b7 Once an invention has been developed, the inventor has to decide whether to exploit the  \ninvention for personal benefits as provided by the statutory laws of the country or put it in  \nthe public  domain.  \n\uf0b7 By and large, the inventor prefers the former option. Only a miniscule of inventions is  \nplaced  in the  public  domain without claiming  any benefits.  \n  Page 15 https://v tucode.in\nRM& IPR \u2013 BRMK557\n  \n \uf0b7 In the latter case, anybody can exploit the innovation for commercial or societal benefit  \nwithout paying  any money  to the  inventor.  \n\uf0b7 If the owner of an invention wishes to seek monetary gains, he can choose from either of  \nthe two options, i.e. patenting or Trade Secret.  If the inventor is  absolutely sure of  \nmaintaining the secrecy of invention for  a very long period (maybe 100 years or more)  \nand the probability of reverse engineering of the technology is nil or very low, then the  \n\u2015Trade  Secret\u2016 category  is preferred",

But,  \nit is not true.  \n\uf0b7 In fact, the majority of patents are granted to inventions displaying an improvement over  \nthe existing  invention.  \n\uf0b7 For example, many patents can be awarded to a  single molecule e.g. penicillin\u2018s (an  \nantibiotic that kills microbes) and its derivatives. The derivatives are made by making  \nsubtle changes  in the structure of the penicillin resulting in new/improved properties,  \nsuch as acid stability or temperature sta bility or killing a wide range of microbes (germs).  \nThe new antibiotic molecules, known  as second,  third or  fourth  generation penicillin\u2018s  \ncan also be patented",

Even hurriedly scribbled notes for an impromptu speec h are considered  \ncopyrightable  material.  \n\uf0b7 The Copyright work has to be expressed by the creator in his frame of thought. In other  \nwords, the work has to be original i.e. the author created it from independent thinking  \nvoid of duplication. This type of work is termed as an Original Work of Authorship  \n(OWA).  It may  appear similar  to already  existing  works but should not be the  same.  \n\uf0b7 The original work may lack quality or quantity or aesthetic merit or all these parameters;  \nstill, it will pass the  test of copyri ghtable  work.  \n    Page 2 https://v tucode.in\nRM& IPR\u2013 BRMK557\n  \n \uf0b7 In addition to originality for the work, Copyright protection also requires at least some  \ncreative effort on the part  of the  author.  \n\uf0b7 There is no minimum limit for the extent of creativeness. It is a subjective matter. The  \nminimal level of cr eativity needed for Copyright protection depends on the judgment of  \nthe evaluator  (adjudicated by  the Office  of Registrar  of Copyright).  \n\uf0b7 As an example, mere changing the dimensions of a book will not be granted Copyright  \nprotection. Similarly, an address b ook of alphabetically arranged telephone numbers does  \nnot qualify for Copyright protection as it involves a straightforward alphabetical listing of  \nphone  numbers rather  than a  creative  selection of  listings.  \n \nOWNERSHIP  OF COPYRIGHT  \n \nThe Copyright  laws clearly state the ownership  of Copyright.  \n \n\uf0b7 The person  who created  the work  is considered  as the first (original)  holder  (owner)  of \nthe Copyright.  \n\uf0b7 In case the author is an employee and has been contracted to do the work by a proprietor  \n(of the company/firm/soci ety /organization, etc.), the owner of the Copyright shall be the  \nproprietor.  \n\uf0b7 The government will be the primary owner of the government work in the absence of any  \nkind of arrangement.  \n\uf0b7 The person delivering  a speech  is the  first owner  of the  Copyright",
